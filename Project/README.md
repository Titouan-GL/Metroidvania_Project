# Project Metroidvania
this project was realized during my studies, it's a small metroidvania game.

Having the SFML library is necessary to run the program.

After having compiled the executable is named `The_game`.

If you find the game too hard you can modifiy your HP by changing `m_life` and `m_maxLife` in the method `Reset()` of the `Player` Class.

It's made on Linux and only executable on Linux. The codeblocks project are still in the file but not really usefull if you don't use codeblocks.
## Commands
- Directionnal arrows : move
- Space : jump
- D : Attack
- Return : select menu options
